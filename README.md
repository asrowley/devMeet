This test is used as part of the recruitment process for developers looking to join zupaTech. We would expect this part normally to take between one and three hours to complete, however there is no fixed time limit and you may spend as long as you wish.

Your code should be written in a way that shows you have a good understanding of software design patterns, SOLID principles and development best practices. You are free to pick any technologies and frameworks you wish, but plese consider how these apply to the role you are applying for. When you are finished you should submit a link to your repository (GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, etc) or provide us with the source code.

If you believe the test is unclear in anyway or you have any questions please ask.

Test
We want to start a monthly developer meetup in Eastleigh to discuss the latest frameworks and technologies. With only a limited number of spaces available, we need a system to be created which will let people book seats for the next meetup. Assuming a separate team are working on the UI we would like you to build the API and backend systems including persisting the data.

In our current meetup space we have 100 seats available, 10 rows of 10 seats, labelled A1 to J10, although in the future this may change. In addition, for now the meetup is free, so there is no need to build in support for taking payment, but we would like it to be easy to add the ability to charge for some meetups in the future.

Requirements
At the point of booking a person will select which seats they want, seats are not automatically allocated.
Two people must not be able to book the same seat.
A single person may book up to four seats in one transaction.
A unique name and email address are required for each seat that is booked.
